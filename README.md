# 🚀 EVE-Online Market Intelligence (Automated Market & Trade Analyzer)

*“Spreadsheets in space — but smarter.”*  
A Python-powered project that uses the **EVE Online ESI** and **EVE Marketer APIs** to identify **profitable trade opportunities**, analyze **regional market trends**, and calculate **safe routes** across New Eden.

## Overview

This project automates **EVE Online market analytics** by pulling live data from:
- **EVE Marketer API** → market buy/sell orders (region-based)
- **EVE ESI API** → item metadata and historical pricing trends

It then:
- 💰 Find **the best equipment to trade** for maximum ISK profit  
- 📊 Calculates profitability and market deltas between regions  
- 📈 Tracks 13-day average price and volume trends  
- 🧮 Outputs a **CSV report** with rich market analytics per item 
- 🛰️ Determine **the safest travel routes** between systems based on kill statistics   

All operations are **multi-threaded** using `python concurrent.futures` for speed -- processing hundreds of items simultaneously.

---

## 🚀 Usage

Run any `ipynb` in colab or local machine:
*change region if needed based on your cuurrent location*

Output will be a CSV file (auto-generated by Pandas) containing all analyzed market data.

##  How It Works

### 1. Item Collection
Fetches all item IDs and names from [Fuzzwork’s type IDs CSV](https://www.fuzzwork.co.uk/resources/typeids.csv).  
Default region: **The Forge (10000002)** — home to Jita.

### 2. Market Data Gathering
For each batch (up to 199 item IDs at once), it requests:
- **Global** data from EVE Marketer (no region)
- **Regional** data limited to The Forge

Both responses are zipped together and processed in parallel.

### 3. Data Analysis
For each item:
- Compares **buy/sell percentiles**, **averages**, and **min/max values**  
- Computes **profit percentage**, **price deltas**, and **market health**  
- Fetches **13-day history** from EVE ESI (`/markets/{region}/history/`)  
- Calculates:
  - 📈 Average daily volume and orders  
  - 📅 Recent price change (%) over 13 days  
  - 💰 Profitability per unit and per region  

### 4. Output
All results are compiled into a **Pandas DataFrame**, then exported as a **CSV report**, including:
- Item name and ID  
- Regional and global buy/sell stats  
- Profit and percentile comparisons  
- 13-day historical metrics  
- Market volume and packaged volume

##  Key Classes and Methods

### `Items` Class
Handles the entire workflow:
- `__init__` — initializes region, headers, and storage
- `ItemInfo()` — fetches market data (runs in threads)
- `makeItemInfoDF()` — parses and computes metrics
- `start()` — orchestrates the full pipeline

### Threading Logic
Uses **`ThreadPoolExecutor`** for:
- Fetching market data (`evemarketerThreads`)
- Processing JSONs into final records (`evetechThreads`)

Example:
```python
itemsInfo.start(199, 37)
```

---




##  Requirements

- Python 3.x  
- Libraries:
  ```bash
  pip install requests pandas numpy
  ```
- Internet connection for API access

---


## ⚡ Performance

- Uses **threaded requests** to process hundreds of items simultaneously.  
- Adjustable thread counts:
  ```python
  itemsInfo.start(evemerketerThreads=199, evetechThreads=37)
  ```

- Typical runtime: depends on number of items (thousands of market calls possible).
